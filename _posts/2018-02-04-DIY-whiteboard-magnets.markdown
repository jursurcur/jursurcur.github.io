For my boyfriend's really belated one-year anniversary and Christmas present, I knew his present had to be epic especially since his 20th birthday present for me was [skydiving](/assets/images/skydiving.jpg) passes.

Don't get me wrong. I'm a very thoughtful person, but I also have inconveniently high expectations. I REFUSE to gift a present that I'm not satisfied with even if it means the person never receiving one. (Sorry Katherine! I promise that you'll get your 21st birthday present before you turn 22.)

Anyways, if you thought I was a workaholic, then my boyfriend is the definition of one. For example, on our first Valentine's, I got him an electric kettle packed with snacks, tea, and ramen, all necessities to help him power through late nights. So I knew I had to get him a present that he would use to streamline his already inhuman productivity.

He's a CS/ELEC major and math minor, carries Expo markers on him like he'll spontaneously derive equations, and has TA'd every course in his curriculum. You now probably understand how a whiteboard could ever become a present. Besides, he was terribly lacking in room decor. To give you an idea, he taped a figure from a neuro paper onto his wall. #art

I got the idea to make custom magnets when I went to Texas Art Supply with Kira, my incredibly talented pre-dental BIOS/VADA friend and fellow coffee shop 'n werk connoisseur. (Stay posted for our joint coffeeshop 'n werk blog.) I bought a 2-pack 4"x6" [magnet sheet](https://www.texasart.com/group/3831/102) and a 2-pack 5"x7" [magnetic photo pocket](https://www.texasart.com/group/3830/102).

I then started brainstorming inside jokes to base my magnets off of. Over the past year, Aidan and I have created our own catchphrases, including some in Chinese. The hardest part was illustrating text. I had to get real creative with color theory and texture, but I learned a couple techniques in Illustrator, and I also downloaded open sourced brush libraries.

I learned to create a hatched drop shadow text effect through this YouTube [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVij2CNspjE), and the colorful transparent overlay effect is done by changing the transparency settings from "normal" to "multiply." For this project, I worked exclusively with these [Stipple Shading](https://blog.spoongraphics.co.uk/freebies/8-free-stipple-shading-brushes-for-adobe-illustrator) and [Doodle Sketch](http://www.melsbrushes.co.uk/free-illustrator-brushes-natural-sketch-doodle-lines-set/) brushes.

I organized my designs into 2 sets of 4"x6" blocks (as pictured above), printed a copy onto 8.5"x11" 60 lb paper, adhered it to the 2 magnet sheets, and cut each design out. Overall, I'm really happy with this DIY project! He loves his personalized whiteboard and even brought it to teach his students at TA sessions.
